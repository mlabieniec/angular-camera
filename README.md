### angular-camera
An angular directive to render a web camera with either getUserMedia (if available) or flash. Also provides an interface (thanks to https://github.com/cthayur/CamCapture) for taking snapshots through flash and rtc.

### Usage
Just include `'angular-camera'` in your angular application modules, than add to your html. Options are configurable in your controller and mimic options for CamCapture.

`<camera
	rtc="rtc"
	options="options"></camera>`
